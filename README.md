# Nearsoft Questions

**Please do not push into master branch. A new version is deployed to heroku each time a push is done. Use [dev](https://github.com/Nearsoft/questions/tree/dev) or any other branch.**

## Why ?
It's not easy to find answers to internal processes questions. We might ask directly to the person who is we think is responsible for, however we are not documenting the answers we get.

This project aims to create a centralized repository of answers to common questions we have as company.

## Sample problem we'd like to solve:
 - We are trying to duplicate questions looking for answers in a centralized place before going to the person.
 - Minimize the time users spent asking other people and waiting for her/his response

### Technology used to reach the goal
 - Spring Boot
 - Spring Data
 - PostgreSQL
 - Hibernate for entities management
 - Hibernate Search or Elastic Search for searching capabilities (still pending to define)
 - React JS as front end framework

You can see the [prototype online](https://nsquestions.herokuapp.com)
